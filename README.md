# ChimneyTinyCornerShelf3DModel
This project aims to create a 3D model of a small corner shelf designed to be placed on a fireplace. The shelf is designed to maximize the use of available space and add a decorative touch to your fireplace. The model is generated using OpenSCAD, a parametric design software, and it's exported in STL format, ready to be 3D printed.
