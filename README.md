# ChimneyTinyCornerShelf3DModel

**Project Description**

This project aims to create a 3D model of a small corner shelf designed to be placed on a fireplace. The shelf is designed to maximize the use of available space and add a decorative touch to your fireplace. The model is generated using OpenSCAD, a parametric design software, and it's exported in STL format, ready to be 3D printed.

**Usage Instructions**

1. **Install OpenSCAD**: If you don't have OpenSCAD installed yet, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html).

2. **Download the Model**: Clone or download this GitHub repository to access the model files.

3. **Customize the Model**: Open the model file in OpenSCAD to customize the parameters according to your needs. You can adjust the dimensions, style, and other features of the corner shelf.

4. **Generate the STL File**: Once you've customized the model, generate the STL file using OpenSCAD.

5. **3D Printing**: Use the generated STL file to 3D print the corner shelf on your 3D printer. Ensure that you select the appropriate print settings, such as print quality, infill density, and material.

**Contributions**

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you have improvements to make to the model, corrections to apply, or ideas for new features, feel free to create a pull request. Please ensure compliance with code quality and documentation standards.
